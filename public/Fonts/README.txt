This folder should contain font files required by the etvs UI.

The etvs global CSS references /Fonts/PIXEARG_.TTF. That file is not present in the repository.

Please copy your PIXEARG_.TTF file here (path: public/Fonts/PIXEARG_.TTF) so the etvs styling matches the original design.

If you prefer a different font filename, update `etvs-src/styles/globals.css` to point to the correct path.
